## Talk about a time that you required input from a co-worker who was not being responsive, but you needed to get their input for you to continue. How did you handle this situation?

A common scenario where this type of problem occurs is with leadership being indecisive about a tough decision. In general I find that these sorts of problems have more to do with missing knowledge. You can get stuck on a problem not realize all the information is not in front of you until you have laid it all out. In the past I've tried to orginize a meeting with that individual to discuss the problem and resolve the blocker.
